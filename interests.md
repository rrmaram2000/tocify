## narrative
My research interests lie at the intersection of classical harmonic analysis and modern deep learning. I am particularly focused on wavelet design, drawing from the fundamental work of Ingrid Daubechies on compactly supported wavelets and Gilbert Strang and Truong Nguyen on the relationship between wavelets and filter banks.

Furthermore, I am exploring learnable wavelets and invariant representations, inspired by Stephane Mallat's work on scattering transform networks which bridge the gap between fixed wavelet filters and the hierarchical structures of deep learning. I aim to utilize these multiresolution signal decompositions to improve sparsity and stability in neural network architectures.
