arXiv:2602.17706v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modeling long-range dependencies in time series generation poses a fundamental trade-off between representational capacity and computational efficiency. Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. P…

arXiv:2602.17776v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Physics-governed models are increasingly paired with machine learning for accelerated predictions, yet most "physics--informed" formulations treat the governing equations as a penalty loss whose scale and meaning are set by heuristic balancing. This blurs operator structure, thereby confounding solution approximation error with governing-equation enforcement error and making the solving and learning progress hard to interpret and control. Here we i…

arXiv:2602.17892v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In large-scale X-ray computed tomography (CT), matrix-free iterative methods are essential due to the prohibitive cost of explicitly forming the system matrix. In practice, forward projectors and backprojectors are often implemented with different discretizations or accelerations, leading to unmatched projector pairs. This mismatch violates the adjointness assumptions underlying classical least-squares solvers, so the resulting iterations no longer…
